A backend server that supports the Automated Students Clearance System a tool to manage student clearance workflows, roles, and approvals for educational institutions. This repository serves as the server component for an authentication/authorization template used across projects.

Important: This is the anthonyc-dev/auth-templat server you can view the auth template repository here: [Backend](https://github.com/anthonyc-dev/auth-template).

## Overview
The Automated Students Clearance System server exposes RESTful endpoints to:
- Manage student records and clearance status
- Coordinate approval flows between departments
- Authenticate users and assign roles (student, admin, HR, department officer)
- Send notifications or provide data for frontend dashboards

This server is intended to be used together with a frontend portal and can be adapted to different authentication templates notably the anthonyc-dev/auth-templat repository referenced above.

---

## Features
- User registration & login
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Student clearance workflow management (request, review, approve/reject)
- Audit logs / activity history (recommended)
- REST API for integration with frontends or third-party systems
- Configurable email/notification hooks (optional)
- Docker-ready for containerized deployments

---

## Tech stack
(Adjust these to match the actual implementation in the repo)
- Node.js (LTS)
- Express (or your preferred Node framework)
- TypeScript (recommended)
- PostgreSQL (or another relational database)
- JWT for authentication
- Docker & Docker Compose

---

## Getting started

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL (or as configured)
- Docker (optional)

Basic install (example)
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/anthonyc-dev/Automated-students-clearance-system.git
2. Change directory
   cd Automated-students-clearance-system
3. Install dependencies
   npm install
4. Create and populate `.env` (see Environment variables below)
5. Run database migrations (if applicable)
   npm run migrate
6. Start the server (development)
   npm run dev

---

## Environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root. Typical variables:
- PORT=3000
- NODE_ENV=development
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
- SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS (if email is used)
- OTHER_APP_SPECIFIC_SETTINGS=...

Adjust names to match the configuration used in the repository.

---

## Run (development & production)
- Development (with hot-reload)
  npm run dev
- Build & Run production
  npm run build
  npm start
- Docker (example)
  docker build -t asc-server .
  docker run -e DATABASE_URL="..." -p 3000:3000 asc-server

(Replace commands with the actual scripts defined in package.json)

---

## API overview
A short example of typical endpoints (confirm actual routes in the repo):
- POST /api/auth/register — register user
- POST /api/auth/login — obtain JWT
- GET /api/users — list users (admin)
- POST /api/clearances — create clearance request (student)
- GET /api/clearances/:id — get clearance request
- PATCH /api/clearances/:id/approve — approve request (role-protected)

Always consult the codebase or API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI) for the definitive contract.

---

## Authentication
- JWT-based authentication recommended
- Role claims embedded in tokens for RBAC
- Protect endpoints by role (e.g., only HR or department officers can approve clearances)

If using the anthonyc-dev/auth-templat as a base, follow its conventions for token generation and middleware.

---

## Deployment
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Recommended: run behind a reverse proxy (NGINX) and enable TLS
- Use Docker + Docker Compose or Kubernetes for production orchestration
- Perform regular backups of the database

---

## For HR or Visitors
Hello HR / Visitor  this repository contains the server-side logic for the Automated Students Clearance System. If you are reviewing this for hiring, audit, or evaluation:
- The server exposes role-protected APIs for user and clearance management.
- The project pairs with front-end applications and the anthonyc-dev/auth-templat repo for authentication patterns.
- You can view the authentication template and supporting code here: [Backend](https://github.com/anthonyc-dev/auth-template).  
If you need, I can provide:
- A short walkthrough of key modules and endpoints
- Example API requests (Postman collection)
- Deployment artifacts (Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests)
